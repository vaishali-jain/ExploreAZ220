Managing IOT Central with Azure CLI
List all iot central applications in a resource group
az iot central app list --resource-group my-rg
Create an Application
az iot central app create
              --resource-group my-rg
              --name my-app
              --subdomain myappdomain
              --display-name "my sample app"
              --location Europe
              --sku ST0
Here ST0 is a pricing tier, if not specified, it defaults to Standard 2
Update an Application to change the existing application one or more properties at once
az iot central app update
             --resource-group my-rg
             --name my-app
             --set subdomain=mynewdomain
             --set displayName="My new name"
Delete an Application
az iot central app delete
              --resource-group my-rg
              --name my-app
Get Registration info for all devices in an application with id my-app-id.
To find the application id there are 2 ways:
1. Navigate to Iot central website -> Settings -> Application -> Management -> Application Id
2. Navigate to IOT central in Azure portal -> Settings -> Properties -> Application Id
This query can take long time to run if there are lots of devices in the application
az iot central diagnostics registration-summary
              --app-id my-app-id
Monitor Device Telemetry : shows the telemery sent from devices to iotcentral. By default it shows telemery for all devices. For a specific device include 
device-id in the command
properties parameter indicates which kind of properties to output :  system propeties, application properies or all kinds
az iot central diagnostics monitor-events
              --app-id my-app-id
              --device-id device-id1
              --properties all
Monitor Property Updates: Shows reported and desired properties to and from the devices in IOT central
az iot central diagnostics monitor-properties 
          --app-id my-app-id
          --device-id device-id1
***Validate Messages against the device template : It checks the telemetry messages and outputs data that doesn't match the device template. Used to find 
model mismatches, device id is optional, max messages indicate the max no. of messages to receive from the target device and it is optional. default value is 10,
0 will get all messages
az iot central diagnostics validate-messages
          --app-id my-app-id-1
          --device-id device-id1
          --max-messages 20

Validate Reported properties sent from a device to IOT central. It finds properties that are not modeled in the device template and also properties with the 
same name in multiple interfaces. appid and device id are mandatory
az iot central diagnostics validate properties
          --app-id my-app-id
          --device-id device-id1
