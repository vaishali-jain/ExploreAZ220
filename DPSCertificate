In order to enroll device using x509 certificates with enrollment group in Device Povisioning service, we need chain of x509 certificate and device certificate. 
This is only applicable in development environment.
For production environment, we should use certificates that are signed by trusted certificate authority like DigiCert.

To generate certificate we will use the script from the below repo provided by microsoft
https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/main/tools/CACertificates/ca-certs.ps1

Open Powershell ISE in admin mode
Set execution policy to unresricted to allow powershell to run the script
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
2. We need to have openssl installed. If it is not installed, install using Chocolatey software or from https://www.openssl.org/.
Point the env variable to cnf file in your installation
3. $ENV:OPENSSL_CONF="C:\Program Files\Git\usr\ssl\openssl.cnf"
4. Load THE script in powrshell
6. Verify that all prereqs are in order: Test-CACertsPrerequisites
7. Generate certificate chain using the cmd "New-CACertsCertChain ecc"
ecc indicates encryption method to use. Ecc stands for eeliptic curve cryptography is recommended for ca certfs, rsa can be used if you are creating certfs for
edge
Console message states that it has generated 3 intermediate ca certificates and 1 rootca certficate

Next step is to generate client certificates for sample iot devices under intermediate certificate at level1
New-CACertsDevice DemoDevice1 -signingCertSubject "CN=Azure IoT CA TestOnly Intermediate 1 CA"
New-CACertsDevice DemoDevice2 -signingCertSubject "CN=Azure IoT CA TestOnly Intermediate 1 CA"

Whole certificate chain (Root certificate, Intermediate certificate, Client certificate) is now in place.
