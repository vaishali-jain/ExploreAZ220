Demo: install and configure security agent on a device
1. use ubuntu 18.8 image vm as device and enable ssh access
2. install security gent
3. the state of moduletwin changes to connected
4. login to device by opening azure cloud shell and connect with ssh
5. ssh admin@50.150.18.36
6. configure this device to connect to iothub using c# version of security agent using device symmetric keys
7. on our device we need to store the symmetric key in a file:
echo "your key" > sym.key
8. Download azure security agent
https://github.com/Azure/Azure-IoT-Security-Agent-CS/tree/master/src/Agent/Linux/
wget https://github.com/Azure/Azure-IoT-Security-Agent-CS/tree/master/src/Agent/Linux/...

 https://github.com/Azure/Azure-IoT-Security-Agent-CS/releases/download/0.0.6
9. After download completes, extract the contents using below command and navigate to install directory
tax -xzvf ubuntu-18.04-x64.tar.gz && cd Install
go to install directory and give the isntalled security agent script the execurte script permission

chmod +x InstallSecurityAgent.sh
sudo ./InstallSecurityAgent.sh -i -aui Device -aum SymmetricKey -f ../s.key -hn iot-ps-eastus.
it contains the path to our symmetric key file, iot hub's hostname and deviceid
this command
a. installs any prerequisite software required
b. then adds a service user with interactive sign-in disabled and adds the agent itself as a daemon
c. configures pseudousers so that it can perform some tasks as root user
d. configures the agent with authentication params that we provided

reboot the device to complete installation
now check the status: 
systemctl status ASCIoTAgent.service
make sure theagent is loaded and running
Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/ASCIoTAgent.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
Active: active
In Azure portal, in iothub, module identity status is changed to connected
