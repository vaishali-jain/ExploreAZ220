> A console app acts as iot device. when it runs, it copntacts DPS and provisno the device. if successful, device provisioning service will return some credentials
which we wil use to connect to iothub and send some data
we wil use self signed certificate to do an indivdual enrollment
Generate certificate and pfx file using the GenerateTestCertificate script
in order for device to communicate with DPS, we need to configure an enrollment
enrollment is adding device details to DPS
Device enrllment is a record of a single device or a group of devices that may register with Device Provisioning service at some point in the future
the enrollment record contains details of how the device will attest with DPS as well as the policy that determines how the iothub is assigned
ex: we may have multiple iothubs and may want to assign devices evenly across them
In the solution configure device. 
  a. add pfx file to root of the solution 
  b. configure url of DPS and idscope, certificate name, password
  c. security provider tells client what security method we ae using i.e., x509
