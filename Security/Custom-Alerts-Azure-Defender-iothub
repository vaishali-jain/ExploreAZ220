Azure defender for IOT use advanced algorithms and machine learning to detect security threats in iot infra

Alerts warn you when specific device behaviour deviates from its expected behaviour.

Example: we have an iot device that tracks the temperature and humidity in a room, and allows managers to better monitor the room conditions
we know that the software on the device is configured to send a message once every 10 seconds. so that we receive 6 messages in every minute,  but 
if we start receivng 3 msgs per minute or may be 400 msgs per minute this suggests that there is an issue with the device.. may be there is no limit on no. of active 
connections or certain inbound ip address ranges changes
using these we can define our custom alerts

we have 14 diff types of alerts dividided into 2 categories
1. Alert where we are checking that a value falls in a certain range. we define min value, max value and time period within which it should apply
it can be 5,10,15,20,25... minutes
ex: we can check no. of file uploads or no. of device to cloud msgs for a given protocol or no. of rejected msgs
2. operations that are not allowed
Ex:inbound connection by ip address: we can specify ip address range, it does not prevent access to device instead create a alert in dashboard

Security groups: logical collection of custom alerts
diff rule for devices deployed in a specifc geographic location
you ust specifyedvices to security group. by default there is default security group
there can be diff devices with diff requirements

Steps to assign Security Group to a device
1. modify the device twin state and tag it
"version":3,
"tags":{
"SecurityGroup":"default"
},
"properties":{}

Create a tag collection and add SecurityGroup property along with name of our security group
Her, tags collection should go after version property and before properties element
we can use SG to define device with specific hardware or geo location
